Question 1: Explain how 1D convolution can be used to identify the edges in an image:

1D convolution with the filter [-1, 1] identifies edges by detecting intensity changes.
Negative values capture intensity decreases, and positive values capture increases, producing peaks at edge positions.
This technique applies similarly to images: convert to 1D, convolve with an edge-sensitive filter, and find peaks to locate edges.



Question 3: Why does the validation error increase when the number of epochs is increased, and how to prevent it:

When the validation error increases with more epochs, it's a sign of overfitting.
To prevent overfitting, you can:
Implement early stopping: Stop training when validation error starts to increase.
Apply regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization.
Use dropout: Randomly deactivate connections during training.
Increase the amount of training data if possible.
Explanation of why mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent converges faster than batch Gradient Descent:

Batch Gradient Descent considers the entire dataset in each step, which can be time-consuming.
Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent updates parameters using smaller batches of data, allowing for more frequent updates.
This frequent updating can lead to faster convergence compared to the batch Gradient Descent, as it doesn't wait for the entire dataset to be processed in each iteration.
